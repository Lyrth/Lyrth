## Hello there :O

Yes henlo! Here you can see the projects I'm working on, most actively **'Makanism'** (currently work-in-progress), a Java bot using the epic library, Discord4J.
Also, currently I am working on some other private projects in C and Java. I also do some Starbound modding, Lua stuff, and microcontroller programming. Sift around, I also do other probably unrelated stuff lol.
